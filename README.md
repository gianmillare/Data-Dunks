# Data-Dunks (Currently under construction, updating the application for UC Berkeley's Demo Day)

Project: DataDunks
https://data-dunks.herokuapp.com/

As a second capstone project in my struggle to become a Data Scientist, my fellow data peers and I created an interactive website that simulates a fantasy match between basketball legends. Data was scraped from https://www.nba.com/ and https://www.basketball-reference.com/ then altered using Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The end results is a simulated web application where users can input their favorite basketball players to "compete" in matches consisting of One vs. One or Team vs. Team. This website also contains a sub-section where users can input any player in the dataset and discover their best seasons statistics. More information can be found on the "About Us" page within the application.
